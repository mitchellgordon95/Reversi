This is a python implementation of the game [Reversi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi).

I was on a plane from Shanghai to Singapore, and it was offered on the in-flight
entertainment system. I figured it might be fun to implement a short brute-force
method to give me future sight, since I wasn't doing anything else.

It's only practical up until 5 steps, however. I think, obviously, more
sophistication is needed (RL or something.)

Since I wrote it in an hour, I bet there's something wrong with it. FYI.
